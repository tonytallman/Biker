## Purpose

The purpose of this package is to demonstrate how multiple teams can work on multiple packages concurrently if the packages are independent (decoupled). This scales infinitely as you could theoretically work on as many packages as you have teams.

> **NOTE**
> The content of this package is too small to warrant its own package. It is just to demonstrate the concept of truly decoupled packages.
